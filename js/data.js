    id: 'hidden-gate',
    title: 'Hidden Gate Game',
    kind: 'Project',
    year: 2025,
    tags: ['Unity', 'Blender', 'Game design'],
    image: 'assets/images/hidden-gate-1.jpg',
    summary: 'An exploration adventure where Rocky collects five fragments to unlock a hidden gate, built with Blender and Unity.',
    process: 'Concept: Hidden Gate is an exploration adventure centered around Rocky’s journey to discover the hidden gate. The player explores the environment, searches through the area, and collects five scattered fragments needed to unlock the gate. Through discovery, movement, and progression, the experience builds excitement until Rocky finally opens the Hidden Gate. Character: the character was designed using Blender, starting with sculpting based on a reference to define the overall form and proportions. Environment: the environment was created in Blender by blocking out the layout using basic shapes, with modifiers used to improve efficiency. Gamification design: in Unity, assets were imported from Blender (FBX) and scenes (main menu, options, gameplay) were organized with a structured folder system. Fragments were connected to a collector script so when picked they disappear with particle and sound effects; the UI (Play, Options, Quit) was built under Canvas and linked to scripts; the character was updated with animations set up in the Animator Controller (idle, walk, run, jump).',
    learning: 'Challenges: activating the gate only after collecting five fragments was challenging; this was fixed by implementing a script that tracks collected items and triggers the gate once all fragments are obtained. Player engagement: maintaining player excitement during fragment collection was challenging; this was fixed by using engaging background music to keep the player motivated and immersed.'

    title: 'UniDine: Smart Meal Planning App',
    kind: 'Project',
    year: 2025,
    tags: ['UX research', 'App concept', 'Service design'],
    image: 'assets/images/unidine-1.jpg',
    summary: 'A smart meal planning app concept: improve meal quantity estimates and let students reserve meals and earn reward points.',
    process: 'Objective: Improve meal quantity estimates to enhance the dining experience. Allow students to reserve meals and earn reward points for free meals. Stakeholder analysis: the most important stakeholders are Students (main users), Cafeteria Management (runs services) and University Administration (provides approval and support); the key relationships are Students and Cafeteria Management (demand), Cafeteria Management and University Administration (support), and Cafeteria Management and Kitchen Staff (operations). Knowledge gap analysis: assumptions and gaps rated 1–5 for risk to project success — customers/students will commit to the app (5, attitudinal), the peak hours and seasons are unknown (3, behavioral/factual), the average daily customer numbers are unknown (4, behavioral), and the prize will encourage the customers/students (4, attitudinal). Survey analysis: the survey was conducted on a small scale with 14 students to study the project’s knowledge gaps — the majority of students have experienced shortages before, breakfast and lunch are twice as common as dinner, most students are interested in trying the app, and 80% showed interest in a free meal reward. Interview analysis: problems faced during peak hours (avoiding peak hours, waiting a long time, overcrowding annoyance), experience of food shortage (late arrival with no food, favorite food runs out, frequent occurrence) and suggestions for improvement (prefer a website, informative notifications only, clear interface and accurate menu). Benchmarking: NUSmart Dining App, choosi and Nutrislice compared by user, format, usability, estimation and experience.',
    learning: 'From the survey and interviews, it was clear that students often face food shortages and long waiting times, especially during peak hours. Benchmarking with other smart dining apps showed how pre-ordering and accurate demand tracking can reduce these issues. The UniDine app builds on these insights by helping the cafeteria prepare the right portions, reducing waste, and encouraging student commitment through rewards. The next step will involve testing the UniDine app with a larger group of students to validate its effectiveness.'

    title: 'The Hero Journey',
    kind: 'Project',
    year: 2025,
    tags: ['Blender', 'Character animation', 'Sculpting'],
    image: 'assets/images/hero-journey-1.jpg',
    summary: 'A character animation exploring identity and self-awareness: a hero chasing his shadow as it fades away.',
    process: 'Concept: This project focuses on storytelling through character animation, exploring the concept of identity and self-awareness. The narrative follows a main character chasing a shadow that represents external judgments and expectations, gradually realizing that these influences do not define who they are. The project combines sculpting, texturing, rigging, and animation in Blender, along with simulations and camera work to build an emotional and cinematic experience. Sculpting head and body: the head and body were created using Blender’s sculpting tools, starting from a base mesh; brushes like Grab, Clay and Smooth were used to shape the form and refine facial features and body proportions. Texture and rigging: the texture was created and refined using vertex paint, with reference images used to match realistic skin tones; the rig was built bone by bone to ensure accurate structure and control. Simulations and animation: each movement was controlled by adding keyframes to different parts of the body, an earthquake simulation was applied with table objects parented to the wall, and smoke and fade simulations were applied to the shadow.',
    learning: 'Understanding how to combine storytelling with character design, apply the full character workflow (sculpting, rigging, animation), and use camera movement and simulation to enhance emotional impact and narrative delivery.'

    title: 'Taif Rose Perfume Branding',
    kind: 'Project',
    year: 2025,
    tags: ['Photoshop', 'InDesign', 'Branding'],
    image: 'assets/images/taif-rose-perfume-branding-1.jpg',
    summary: 'A perfume brand inspired by the Taif Rose, turning its cultural value into a modern visual identity in Photoshop and InDesign.',
    process: 'Objective: Create a perfume brand inspired by the Taif Rose, highlighting its cultural value and transforming it into a modern visual identity. Research: Studied the history, harvesting process, and cultural meaning of Taif Rose. Ideation: Explored logo shapes inspired by rose petals and Saudi aesthetics. Prototype: Designed early logo variations, color palettes, and layout tests. Final execution: logo creation (Photoshop), advertisement design using real rose field imagery, 4-page booklet layout (InDesign), color palette + patterns + product mockups.',
    learning: 'This project improved my skills in branding, layout design, and using Photoshop and InDesign together. I learned how cultural elements can be translated into a modern identity and how color, imagery, and composition influence the final message. Feedback helped refine alignment, contrast, and logo balance.'

    id: '3d-hotel-letter-h',
    title: '3D Hotel – Letter H Concept',
    kind: 'Project',
    year: 2025,
    tags: ['Blender', '3D Modeling', 'Lighting'],
    image: 'assets/images/3d-hotel-letter-h-1.jpg',
    summary: 'A 3D hotel inspired by the shape of the letter H, modeled in Blender with interiors, lighting and materials.',
    process: 'Objective: Design a 3D hotel inspired by the shape of the letter H, using Blender to model interiors, lighting, materials, and render scenes that express the theme clearly. Research: Explored how letters can transform into architectural forms and how interior elements communicate function. Ideation: Sketched layouts based on the H shape and planned different rooms (reception, bedrooms). Modeling: Built all furniture and architectural elements from scratch using Blender tools and modifiers. Lighting: Tested daylight and night lighting to enhance mood and realism. Final execution: Rendered multiple scenes showing the hotel’s spaces, materials, and atmosphere.',
    learning: 'This project strengthened my skills in 3D modeling, lighting, and materials. I learned how to translate a simple letter shape into a functional architectural concept and how lighting dramatically affects the scene’s mood. Feedback helped me refine proportions, add detail, and improve render quality.'
